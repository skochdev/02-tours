# Tours mini project

* Fetching tours from an api using `fetch`, **async / await** syntax and `useEffect()`
* Storing them in state using `useState()`
* Implementing sort of state machine to render according to the current state (showing content, loading content, showing error if occurred)
* Some responsiveness, although without any particular media queries
